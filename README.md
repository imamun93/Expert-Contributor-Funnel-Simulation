# üß† Expert Contributor Funnel Simulation ‚Äì Growth Ops Practice Project

## ‚ú® Overview

This project simulates the core responsibilities of a **Growth Operations Lead** at a company like **Handshake AI**‚Äîwhere PhD-level experts are recruited, trained, and activated as contributors to improve large language models (LLMs).

Using a realistic, end-to-end funnel simulation with **Python, SQL-style logic, and Excel-style KPIs**, this project demonstrates how to:

- Track contributor progression through key funnel stages
- Identify drop-offs and performance gaps
- Analyze and visualize contributor quality and efficiency
- Propose data-driven improvements to training and activation workflows

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Python** (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- **SQL-style queries** (via `pandas.query()` or SQLite)
- **Excel/Sheets-style metrics** (conversion %, drop-off, activation time)
